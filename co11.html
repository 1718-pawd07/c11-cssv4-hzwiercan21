		<p>The Vampire Diaries is a TV show that aired from September 10, 2009 to March 10, 2017.</p>
		<p>The show is about The series follows the life of 17-year old Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), who falls in love with a centuries old vampire named Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) and his brother Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder), also a vampire. She lives a troubled life as an orphan as her parents died in a car accident, while she was in the car but she was the only survivor. Elena lives with her Aunt Jenna (Sara Canning) and her 16 year old brother Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen).</p>
		<p>In my opinion I love this show because Elena gets all of the support and love she needs from her friends who are always there by her side. Also, I love all of the characters. They all play their part perfectly and are just amazing at portraying their character. However, there are some down sides to the show. This show is like an emotional rollercoaster. An episode can start out happy and funny and then the next it could go to you sobbing. I have cried about this show so many times that I think I cried more then my actual problems.</p>
